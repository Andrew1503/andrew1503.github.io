				Hello, want to learn a bit about me?
			</h3>
			<p>
				Educated in graphic and web design, I've since gravitated more towards writing code.
				I do tend to focus more on the visual side of software development. My graphic design 
				training has transferred into crafting great user experiences. Software isn't all visuals
				though, and I've come to enjoy the beauty of well crafted backend code.
				I've been employed as a full stack web developer now for several years, working mainly
				with Laravel and Angular.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When I'm not writing code, some of my hobbies include:

		Spending time with my dog, Gilly. She's a super sweet labrador mix. We do lots of 
		obedience training, her latest achievement was becoming an AKC certified Good Citizen!

		Tinkering on my cars. You'll often find me at local cars and coffee meets.

		an autocross event sometime soon.
